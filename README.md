   - Code is analyzed and embedded using AI models

2. **Q&A System**
   - Questions are processed against embedded codebase
   - Relevant code sections are retrieved using vector similarity
   - AI generates contextual responses with code references

3. **Commit Analysis**
   - New commits are automatically detected
   - Diff analysis is performed using AI
   - Summaries are generated and stored
